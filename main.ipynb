The main components are:\\n\\n1. **Planning**: This involves two sub-components:\\n   - **Subgoal and decomposition**: The agent breaks down large tasks into smaller, manageable subgoals. This enables the efficient handling of complex tasks by dividing them into simpler, more manageable parts.\\n   - **Reflection and refinement**: The agent can perform self-criticism and self-reflection over past actions. This allows the agent to learn from mistakes and refine them for future steps, thereby improving the quality of final results.\\n\\n2. **Memory**: Although the context provided does not delve deeply into the specifics of the memory component, it is mentioned as a crucial part of the agent system, suggesting that the agent's ability to recall past experiences and learned information is vital for its operation and decision-making processes.\\n\\nThe combination of these components, with LLM at the core, enables the agent to behave conditionally based on past experiences and to interact with other agents or its environment in a more sophisticated manner. This architecture is designed to support the agent in solving complex tasks and learning from its actions, making it a powerful general problem solver.\""
